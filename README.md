## Description of Sorting Algorithms
A driver file is given, main.cc which expects to be linked against another file implementing a class called Sort, which implements an "out-of-place" sort using a "non-in-place" sort in an online fashion.

The first subdirectory, Tests, contains five test files; the largest test file has one million records and occupies almost 100 megabytes of space. The second subdirectory, driver, contains the files main.cc.

The other files in the directory are the Makefile, the test script "test.bash", templates HeapSort.cc and TrieSort.cc, and the implementation header, Sort.h.

There is also a compiled version of valsort from the gensort package found in the tar file which is used for testing.

HeapSort and TrieSort are implemented recursively as a linked version.
